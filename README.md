# Loan-Prediction
In this project, Our main goal is to build a Machine Learning Model to automate the the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. It’s a classification problem , given information about the application we have to predict whether the they’ll be to pay the loan or not.
